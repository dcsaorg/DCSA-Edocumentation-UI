/**
 * DCSA OpenAPI specification for Booking v2 - Beta 1
 * API specification issued by DCSA.org.  For explanation to specific values or objects please refer to the *** [Information Model v2022.1]() *** Will be updated soon ***. This API does not define the business rules regarding what is allowed to update at what time. For this the [BKG IFS]() *** Will be updated soon *** should be consulted.  All other documents related to the Booking publication can be found [here](https://knowledge.dcsa.org/s/publication?publicationId=a0r7T000000L8mmQAC)  It is possible to use this API as a standalone API. In order to do so it is necessary to use the poll-endPoint - /v2/events  in order to poll event information.  It is recomended to implement the [DCSA Documentation Event Hub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DOCUMENTATION_EVENT_HUB) in order to use the push model. Here events are pushed as they occur.  For a changelog please click [here](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/tree/master/bkg/v2#v200B1). Please also [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/issues/new) if you have any questions/comments.
